Keep the commit messages concise and clear. Don't pad them with stuff like "To improve visibility" or 
"Refactored code for clarity and maintainability." or "Enhance event handling in GameClientSessionManager for better 
reliability". State what was done.

Don't use more bullet points than you have to. Eg. adding code to mange a situation along with adding logging for that
situation can be grouped into one bullet point.
